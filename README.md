# 6AR ‚Äì Open-Source 6-Axis Robotic Arm

**6AR** is an diy, industrial-class and open-source **6-axis robot arm** designed from scratch for high performance, reliability, and modularity ‚Äî without the industrial price tag.

Built around a **Teensy 4.1**, a **Raspberry Pi 5**, and a **React-based control interface**, 6AR offers a powerful platform for robotics education, research, automation, and fun!

> This project was born from a personal desire to **challenge myself**, to create something professional-grade using open tools ‚Äî and hopefully inspire a growing community of builders, learners, and tinkerers who share that vision.

## üéØ Vision & Motivation

My goal with this project was to build a robot arm that behaves **as closely as possible to a real industrial 6 axis manipulator**:

- Accurate and smooth motion
- Fully programmable and networked
- Real-time control
- Configurable and extensible
- Affordable (compared to commercial solutions)

I wanted to prove that with modern tools ‚Äî 3D printing, CNC machining, a few well-chosen components, and smart software ‚Äî anyone can build a capable, safe, and powerful robot arm.

I hope others will replicate, improve, and adapt this robot. A community around this could mean:

- üß† Collective development and new features
- üì¶ New end-effectors, programs, or extensions
- üìö Shared learning in robotics, controls, and UI/UX
- ü§ù Helping newcomers bring their robot ideas to life

Built with joy, frustration, tens of thousands of lines of code, and a few cracked tables (Lol, I since put the robot on a steel plate. The inertia was too intense!).
